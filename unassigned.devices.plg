- Fix: Udev information for 'dev/devX' not working properly.  This may be the cause of the incorrect script execution when auto mounting a disk.

- Fix: Change command timeout to show timeout in x.x seconds format.

###2024.10.02
- Fix: Increase timeout when checking for SMB and NFS ports to be open for remote shares.  This should fix the issue where remote shares do not show online and auto mount fails after a reboot.
- Fix: Cannot use 'closetimeo' parameter on SMB remote mounts in Unraid 6.11.
- Add: Option to mount NTFS disks using the Linux NTFS3 module in disk Device Settings.  The NTFS3 module is included in Unraid 7.0.
- Add: Attempt three times to mount remote share devices on initial array start.  Each try is delayed by the "Remote Mount Share Wait Time" UD setting.  This should help with remote servers not being online and ready when Unraid is started.

- Fix: When changing NFS share settings, NFS sharing would not be removed if NFS was turned off.

###2024.05.06
- Fix: Check for remote shares online to only test for open ports to remote servers using name or IP without requiring name resolution.  This will cause some remote shares to show offline after updating.  That can be fixed by just going through the add a share procedure to re-add the remote share and it will update the configuration and fix the offline status.
- Add: Timeout to the page refresh to keep the Unraid wave from never stopping.  After 10 seconds the refresh will time out and display in the device tables that UD cannot refresh the information.

###2024.05.01

- Fix: Disk password stopped working in UD Settings.
- Fix: Cut down on config file writes.

- Fix: Additional work on 'Mounting' and 'Unmounting' status on 'Mount' button.
- Add: Encrypt CIFS setting in Device Settings to optionally encrypt CIFS remote share mounts.  This is best for offsite servers and not on LAN servers because of the encryption overhead.
